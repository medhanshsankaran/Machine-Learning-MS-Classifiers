# Machine-Learning-MS-Classifiers

As shown in our presentation, our project discusses the implications of predicting the income levels of various individuals based on demographic data inputs. We explore 4 different model archetypes: Perceptron, Adaline, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

Our code in Parts 1 and 2 covers the data preprocessing process, Perceptron, and Adaline models.

Our code in Part 3 covers the Logistic Regression model.

Our code in Part 4 covers the SVM model.
